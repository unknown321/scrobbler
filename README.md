### Requirements
  - make
  - Go >= 1.22.1

### Build

```shell
make build
```

### Release

```shell
git submodule update --recursive --init
make release
```

Grab Windows installer/UPG files from `nw-installer/installer/{windows/stock/walkmanOne}` directories.

### Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

### Usage
Before you start, `Device Settings -> Beep Settings` option __must__ be turned off:

<img src="images/beep.png" height="400" alt="beep switch location">

Why? Beeps are inserted in play queue as regular tracks; it resets currently played track.

After that just play some tracks and check for `.scrobbler.log` in root directory on your device.
